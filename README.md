Scikit-learn is a powerful Python library for machine learning. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and analysis, including classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing — all built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
One unique strength of Scikit-learn is its consistent and unified API. Whether you're using a classifier, regressor, or clustering model, all follow the same .fit(), .predict(), and .score() interface — making it incredibly intuitive, beginner-friendly, and easy to swap models in workflows.
